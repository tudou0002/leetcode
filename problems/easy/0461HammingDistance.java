/* Bitwise Operators:
    &, Bitwise AND operator: returns bit by bit AND of input values.
    |, Bitwise OR operator: returns bit by bit OR of input values.
    ^, Bitwise XOR operator: returns bit by bit XOR of input values.
    ~, Bitwise Complement Operator: This is a unary operator which returns the oneâ€™s compliment representation of the input value, i.e. with all bits inversed.
